				your skiing information and needs for the season at no cost
				(except free passes, but we will work on that). Connect with other users
				through the chatroom or pick your next PNW resort destination (or undercover backountry
				adventure) by browsing the trip reports. Looking for gear in good
				condition at a low price? Hoping to sell last year's skis? Head over to the

				Skiers of all ability and ages are welcome in our community. We also allow boarders,
				on a case-by-case basis :) See you on the slopes, keep your fingers crossed for a powder day!
				And as always, we do not have information on all dangers. So, KNOW BEFORE YOU GO.</p></td>
